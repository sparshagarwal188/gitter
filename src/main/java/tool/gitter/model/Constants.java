    public static final String INIT_ACTION_DESCRIPTION = "initializes a new gitter repository in the current directory. It creates a hidden .gitter folder that contains all the necessary metadata, configuration, and internal structures needed for version control.

It displays information about each commit, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message. This command helps users review the projectâ€™s history, track changes over time, and identify specific commits.";

    public static final String ADD_ACTION_DESCRIPTION = "used to stage changes from the working directory into the index (staging area) in preparation for a commit. It captures a snapshot of the specified files at their current state and marks them to be included in the next commit. This command does not modify the repository history or commit anything by itself";
    public static final String DIFF_ACTION_DESCRIPTION = "displays the differences between the working directory and the last commit. It highlights line-by-line changes that have been made to tracked files but not yet staged or committed. This command helps understand what modifications are pending and review changes before staging or committing them.";
